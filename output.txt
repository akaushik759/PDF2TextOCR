TSH levels are subject to circardian variation, reaching peak levels between 2 - 4 AM and
at a minimum between 6 - 10 PM. The variation is of order of 50%, hence time of the day has
influence on measured TSH concentrations.

No RIsk : <1.0
Moderate Risk : 1.0 - 3.0
High RIsk 3.0 -5.9

Acute Inflamation : > 6.0

Interpretation :
The American College of Cardiology Foundations and the American Heart Association recommend :
hs-CRP testing may be useful when men 50 years old or younger and women 60 years old or younger, who have
intermediate risk.
It also may be useful for treatment decisions when men and women are older than these respective ages and

have LDL-C less than 130 mg/L and meet several other criteria, such as no existing heart disease,diabetes, kidney
disease, or inflammatory conditions.

When hs-CRP is evaluated, it may be repeated to confirm that a person has persistent low levels of inflammation.
These values are only a part of the total evaluation process for cardiovascular diseases.

Additional risk factors to be considered are elevated levels of cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, and glucose.
Values higher than 6 are suggestive of acute inflammation and are not useful for cardiac risk evaluation.
